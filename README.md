# EEC 172 RhythmDance
Melanie Tam Brian Chen Group 6

## Project Description
The objective of the final lab was to develop a Rhythm Dance game where a player taps colored arrows at a certain time, which count towards a score after each correct tap timing, leading up to a score. There are stationary arrows on the bottom of the screen and arrows that fall from top to bottom. Once the arrow is overlapping with the stationary arrow,s then you tap but if you don’t tap in time, then you miss the arrow.
